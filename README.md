**Nuget Comparer** is an awesome utility to scan, and report vulnerable nuggets in VS.net.
Visual Studio from my own first-hand experience, doesn't do an excellent job reporting vulnerable nuggets, or knowing why a nuget was flagged as outdated.
This tool was a prototype for an active nuget scanner which will give you few important pieces of information:
1- Why a nugget is vulnerable? Details on github developer pages on why a nuget was flagged as a vulnerability
2- Is there an update available? The tool will give you the last version recommended to install, based on the nuget.org release versions available.   
This is a prototype, and I am working on updating it to have a UI and .NET Core nuggets Support,

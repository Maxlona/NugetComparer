**Nuget Comparer** is an awesome utility to scan and report vulnerable nuggets in VS.net.
From my own first-hand experience with Visual Studio, it doesn't do an excellent job reporting vulnerable nuggets, or knowing why a nuget was flagged as a vulnerable.

This tool was a prototype for an active nuget scanner which will give you few important pieces of information:

  1-**Why a nugget is vulnerable?** Details on github developer pages on why a nuget was flagged as a vulnerability
  2- **Is there an update available?** The tool will give you the last version recommended to install, based on the nuget.org release versions available.   
This is a prototype, and I am working on updating it to have a nice UI && .NET Core nuggets scanning Support,
